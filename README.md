# 🌟 Arduino Smart Cane – Empowering Independence Through Innovation

An Arduino-based assistive device that helps visually impaired individuals navigate safely and independently using ultrasonic obstacle detection.

## 🔹 About the Project
The **Arduino Smart Cane** detects obstacles before physical contact using an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** connected to an **Arduino microcontroller**.  
When an obstacle is detected, the **buzzer and LED** alert the user — and the alert frequency increases as the object gets closer.  

This simple yet powerful system offers real-time feedback, improving mobility confidence and safety for the visually impaired.

## 🔹 Features
- Detects obstacles up to **13 feet** away  
- **Proximity-based alerts** (faster beeps and LED blinking for closer objects)  
- Lightweight, **low-cost** design (~₹800–₹1200)  
- Fully **open-source** and customizable  

## 🔹 Components
- Arduino Uno / Nano  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Piezo Buzzer  
- LED  
- 9V Battery  
- Jumper Wires & PVC Cane  

## 🔹 How It Works
1. The HC-SR04 sensor continuously measures the distance to nearby objects.  
2. The Arduino processes the data.  
3. As the distance decreases, the buzzer beeps and LED blinks faster, helping the user detect obstacles before collision.
